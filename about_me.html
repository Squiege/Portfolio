    <h1>Devin Rider, About Me</h1>

    <h3>Biography:</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Devin Rider, a 25-year-old Back-end developer. Coming from a service background and a love for tech I found myself at a crossroads for something better. Making the leap I decided to follow my passions in tech
        in 2023, starting my programming journey through bootcamps and a passion to better myself and the technology around me. With a love for problem solving and innovation, I strive to innovate smarter and more efficient
        technologies that will further the ever growing industry. With a passion of making thing bigger and better than they already are, I push myself and those around me to develop rich web experiences &amp; web applications.

    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>
        Soothe the curiosity set inside my mind since I was a kid. The passion to explore the technology put in front of me has vanished and a new flame to create and further
        the technology that brought me so much joy as a kid. I hope to achieve a mastery in Back-end development to build faster and more efficient technology. Looking twoards the leaders
        in this space, Google and Amazon. Build and work alongside a strong motivated team that strives for the same innovation that I long for. The ability to bring people together and form relationships
        that are only possible with eachother.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
    <p>
        Growing up I always played video games and it was something my family did to connect with eachother. Now as a adults we find a common interest in Dungeons and Dragons. I hope to
        one day work alongside community members to make the best possible version of Dungeons and Dragons. With VTT's on the rise, taking over the visual space, I hope to work alongside those
        who have worked so hard to advance our tools. Create my own publically used tools that bring campaigns closer and feel more real than ever before.
